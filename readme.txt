Culturally Linked Start Locations
for Civilization 5
v.5

	-- Presentation --

Civilizations (and City-States) will start close to each other depending of their cultural art style (European, Greco-Roman, Middle-East, Asia, South-American, Polynesian)

Culture Group relative distance is also used (ie Greco-Roman civs should be closer to European than Asian civs...) 

It will give better results on maps with a high number of Civilizations (>10)

This mod replace AssignStartingPlots.lua, and will work for all mapscripts.
